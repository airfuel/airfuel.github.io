The supply chain of fuel is a vast and complicated network that spans across the world, connecting the economies and varying infrastructures of the countries that both supply, and use, oil.

Our framework details an elementary version of the paths and network that fuel exists in. Below are explanations of the different parts of our framework:

The fuel (oil) source falls under the specific geo-region that the oil is found in; this oil is then obtained through oil rigs and/or drilling, and transported to refineries.

The refineries act as the intermediary between raw fuel and processed fuel, producing various products to suit varying needs. In our case, it’s petroleum. Once the oil is refined, it can then head out to either a specific location (the customer) right away, or be transported to a terminal.

Terminals act as a bulk storage unit for processed fuels but can also be used for excess raw fuel. From terminals, the fuel can go to the on-site storage of the customer, which can be in the form of fuel trucks, collapsible fuel tanks, aquatic fuel vessels, and more.

It’s important to note that between each node [a point of convergence] is a separate mode of transport, whether that be through ship, truck, or pipeline.

At the end of the network, the customer is there to receive the final product.
