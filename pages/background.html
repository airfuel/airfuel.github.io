## The Problem 
The Air Force Operational Energy Office works to mitigate risk to operational energy availability for the Air Force, to ensure fuel when and where Airmen need it. The fuel supply network is a complex global system, involving government, military, industry, and commercial players. The Operational Energy Office must assess the energy supportability of Air Force operations, which includes identifying risk to the fuel supply network and planning investments that will support concepts of operations in future contingencies. We need the capability to map out the fuel supply network, understand accumulated risk, and, with that in mind, develop plans and operating concepts globally that account for vulnerabilities. The Air Force needs a dynamic tool to help inform future planners to commanders to senior leader decision-makers of the risk. If a warfighter needs access to 300,000 lbs. of jet fuel to refuel a squadron of fighters at a forward base, the Operational Energy Office needs to have the ability to assess the likelihood that the supply will arrive safely and successfully to meet mission requirements.
