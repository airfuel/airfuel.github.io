Without fuel, the world stops. As interns of the SAF-IEN team, the mission imparted to us was to not only figure out a way around that (not having fuel), but to mitigate the risk in the transportation of our fuel (oil) supply and help in the enhancement of our combat capability using energy-informed solutions; in short, making a safer and more efficient pathway for the fuel to get to us, and for us to get to the fuel. 

Our direct project has been to develop the foundation for a system in which the user can manipulate various factors to see the accumulated risk associated with a particular fuel supply route. In our model, the “best” route is the route with the lowest risk and the highest capacity.

In the end, we hope to produce a model with a UI/UX accessible for Airmen [to use while in the plane] to find the most effective path to find fuel necessary to complete the mission.
