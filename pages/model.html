title: Risk Accumulation Model
---
Our interactive model seeks to demonstrate the risk that accumilates when transporting fuel. 

While designing our working prototype, both analyst and layman functions were taken into account-- we want to develop something that everyone who needs to use this, can.

Within the model, the specific nodes derived from current DLA contracts are shown, along with the route that specific line of fuel takes. In the future, different values will be shown to represent the capacity of the mode the transport in between one node to another, the capacity of the various nodes themselves, and the risk in taking that particular path.

Network Configuration 1: Everything

Network Configuration 2: Everything, but with 4 or 5 additional “source” nodes that are right next to 4 or 5 additional demand nodes that can produce about 2000 bbl per day. Suffices for some but not all of the demand from those nodes

Network Configuration 3: Smashed network - what happens with a bunch of edges and/or nodes taken out
