title: Risk Accumulation Model
---
Our interactive model seeks to demonstrate the risk that accumilates when transporting fuel. 

While designing our working prototype, both analyst and layman functions were taken into account-- we want to develop something that everyone who needs to use this, can.

Within the model, the specific nodes derived from current DLA contracts are shown, along with the route that specific line of fuel takes. In the future, different values will be shown to represent the capacity of the mode the transport in between one node to another, the capacity of the various nodes themselves, and the risk in taking that particular path.
